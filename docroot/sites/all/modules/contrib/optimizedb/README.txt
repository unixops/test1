Known issue on sites with Drupal - table cache_form overgrowth. The table
stores the forms cache site and Drupal cache_form not clear when the
Cron-tasks. cache_form may be large, in many times greater than the total
size of all data in the database. Very often this problem, site owners know
when they are running out of disk space, and the problem starts with the site.

The module "OptimizeDB" can for Cron to clean the table cache_form,
the cleaning operation table is safe, even in event of a fall database server
problems on the website will not be. Also, cleaning cache_form can
run independently from the admin area.

The module "OptimizeDB" is also able to optimize the database tables and
display their sizes. Optimizing the tables on Cron, can not perform,
because it may cause problems with the database, so this setting is
not available. However, you can configure the notification of the need
to perform an optimization of tables. When the time comes, the site will
display a message about the need to perform an optimization, the message can
be hidden or perform optimization, and the message will disappear.

If a database table of your site work on the engine InnoDB, it is necessary
from time to time to optimize the table. The fact that the disk on which
the database resides, and tables may greatly be fragmented in the course
of work and to get rid of of fragmentation, it is necessary to carry
out optimization.

I advise you before optimize performance, if your server often have problems
with the database server, make a backup of the database. The danger of losing
data when the through module the optimization of the tables is the same as in
the performance optimization through PHPMyAdmin.
